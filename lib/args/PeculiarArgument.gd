## The abstract intermediate class for some Argument types.
## A PeculiarArgument is an Argument that has a special behavior related to autofillâ€“that being that the content the autofill UI shows to represent the Argument is not actually what is placed in the terminal when it is autofilled. [br][br]
## [b]Note: Full disclosure, I just could not think of an decent name for this class so I asked ChatGPT and it said PeculiarArgument and I thought it was the funniest fing thing ever so here we are. [i]There is really no reason to be referencing this class.[/i][/b]
